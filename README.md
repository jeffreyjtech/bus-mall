## Reflections and Comments

### Lab 11

- I did not hit any major roadblocks with this assignment. That said it was still a lot of coding and, as per usual, more CSS fiddling than I would care to admit.
- The favorite part of my code is how I use array methods to both prevent the same image from rendering twice in one set AND preventing the same image set from being displayed twice in a row.
